This is a front end dev task to test & display my skills as a front end dev.
I chose the tech and tools to build this task out, I intentional did not chose a JS framework so that it is easy to discuss the the JS rather than the JS framework.
A basic search bar with drop downs and dual VanillaJS calendars built using 
- [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/)
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [vanillajs datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanillajs-datepicker)
